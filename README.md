## Introduction
DM is a Data Manager component of the I1820 platform. It handles data that are coming from RabbitMQ and stores them.
It also has some useful built-in queries that can returns data from the database (MongoDB).
We plan to create [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) plugin for it.

## Profiler
Enable MongoDB buit-in profiler:

```
use i1820
db.setProfileLevel(2)
```

The profiling results will be in a special capped collection called `system.profile`
which is located in the database where you executed the `setProfileLevel` command.

```
db.system.profile.find().pretty()
```
## Up and Running
To build this module from source do the following steps

1. Make sure MongoDB is up and running.

2. Install the required dependencies (Please note that we use [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) as our go package manager)
```sh
dep ensure
```

3. Check the configuration in `.env` file. (You can use `.env.example` as an example configuration)

4. Run :runner:
```sh
go build
./dm
```
